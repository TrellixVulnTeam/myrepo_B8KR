myrepo
======

This is a fork from Google [git-repo](https://code.google.com/p/git-repo/).

I use repo to manage projects from work, so there are some features I'd like to add to repo to better suit our needs.

TODO features
====

- [ ] Interactive commits
- [ ] Pull instead of check out in sync
- [ ] Push instead of upload
- [ ] Fetch and rebase
- [ ] git log --branches --not --remotes=origin/\*
- [ ] Tags
- [x] Default not to delete obsolete projects
- [ ] --delete-obsolete option to delete obsolete projects
