myrepo
======

This is a fork from Google [git-repo](https://code.google.com/p/git-repo/).

I use repo to manage projects from work, so there are some features I'd like to add to repo to better suit our needs.

TODO features
====

- Interactive commits
- Pull instead of sync
- Push instead of upload
- Fetch and rebase
- git log --branches --not --remotes=origin/\*
- Tags
- Option for sync not to delete projects that are not in manifest
